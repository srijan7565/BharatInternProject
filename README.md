# BharatInternProject
In this Virtual Internship I have done task on
Titanic Classification! & Number Recognition!
Task - 1 Titanic classification
Task Information
Building a predictive algorithm that can categorize passengers aboard the Titanic as survivors or non-survivors based on a variety of characteristics is the goal.
The Titanic dataset is a classic in the field of data science, and it provides a great chance for learning. Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model choice, and evaluation are all involved.
I am able to apply my theoretical understanding to the data from the Titanic dataset.
This is an opportunity to appreciate the value of feature selection and engineering.
Developing prediction models is a crucial skill.

Task 2 - Number Recognition
Task Information
As my wonderful internship at Bharat Intern continues, I'm excited to start my second project, Number Recognition!
Developing a machine learning model that can recognize and categorize handwritten numbers (0â€“9) is the goal of the task.
A crucial issue in the field of computer vision is number recognition. Model optimization, deep learning methods, and picture preprocessing are all included.
In order to complete this goal, I will investigate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other cutting-edge methodologies.
